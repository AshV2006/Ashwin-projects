# PCB + VLSI Projects Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Ashwin Vijaianand and this repository showcases my hardware engineering projects across PCB design, analog/digital VLSI, and circuit simulation.  These projects demonstrate my experience with tools like **Altium Designer, LTspice, Magic VLSI, and Cadence Virtuoso**.

I'm an ECE undergrad at UT Austin passionate about semiconductor hardware design from PCBs to transistor-level analog circuits.  
This repo reflects my self-driven projects and academic work as I build expertise for future internships in Analog/VLSI design and hardware engineering.



## 🔧 Tools & Skills
- **PCB Design:** Altium Designer (schematics, PCB layout, Gerbers, 3D models)
- **Circuit Simulation:** LTspice
- **VLSI Layout:** Magic VLSI (Sky130 PDK)
- **Analog IC Design:** Cadence Virtuoso (schematic capture, layout, simulation)
- **Scripting:** SKILL, Tcl, Python for automation
